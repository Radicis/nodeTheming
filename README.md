Node Data Set Theming
=====================

Node theming assignment for Advanced Web Publishing module

The task was to find a way to theme or skin a data set with node.

I opted to create a generic "Hero" content view that is configurable from an admin page to accept any data set (within reason) ideally one with an image. 

I achieved this by creating and storing objects which map the data object properties to object properties the view expects while also allowing for any number of custom fields to be added.
